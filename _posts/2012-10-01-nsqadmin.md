`nsqadmin` is a Web UI to view aggregated cluster stats in realtime and perform various
administrative tasks.

### Command Line Options

    -graphite-url="": URL to graphite HTTP address
    -http-address="0.0.0.0:4171": <addr>:<port> to listen on for HTTP clients
    -lookupd-http-address=[]: lookupd HTTP address (may be given multiple times)
    -notification-http-endpoint="": HTTP endpoint (fully qualified) to which POST notifications of admin actions will be sent
    -nsqd-http-address=[]: nsqd HTTP address (may be given multiple times)
    -proxy-graphite=false: Proxy HTTP requests to graphite
    -statsd-interval=1m0s: time interval nsqd is configured to push to statsd (must match nsqd)
    -statsd-prefix="nsq.%s": prefix used for keys sent to statsd (%s for host replacement, must
    -template-dir="": path to templates directory
    -use-statsd-prefixes=true: expect statsd prefixed keys in graphite (ie: 'stats_counts.')
    -version=false: print version string

### statsd / Graphite Integration

When using `nsqd --statsd-address=...` you can specify a `nsqadmin
--graphite-url=http://graphite.yourdomain.com` to enable graphite charts in `nsqadmin`. If using a
statsd clone (like [statsdaemon][statsdaemon]) that does not prefix keys, also specify
`--use-statsd-prefix=false`.

### Admin Notifications

If the `--notification-http-endpoint` flag is set, `nsqadmin` will send a POST request to the
specified (fully qualified) endpoint each time an admin action (such as pausing a channel) is
performed.

The body of the request contains information about the action, like so:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "action": "unpause_channel",
  "channel": "mouth",
  "topic": "beer",
  "timestamp": 1357683731,
  "user": "df",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Iphone 8)"
  "remote_ip": "1.2.3.4:5678"
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `user` field will be filled if a username is present in the request made to `nsqadmin`, say if
it were running with htpasswd authentication or behind [google-auth-proxy][gaproxy], otherwise it
will be an empty string. The `channel` field will also be an empty string when not applicable.

Hint: You can create an NSQ stream of admin action notifications with the topic name `admin_actions`
by setting `--notification-http-endpoint` to `http://addr.of.nsqd/put?topic=admin_actions`

### Metrics

The following metrics are exposed through `nsqadmin` on Topic, Channel and Client Connections.

#### Message Queues:

* `Depth`: Current sum of messages in memory + on disk (i.e. the "backlog" of messages pending delivery).
* `In-Flight`: Current count of messages delivered but not yet finished (`FIN`), requeued (`REQ`) or timed out.
* `Deferred`: Current count of messages that were requeued and explicitly deferred which are not yet available for delivery.

#### Statistics:

* `Requeued`: Total times a message has been added back to the queue due to time outs or explicit requeues.
* `Timed Out`: Total times a message has been requeued after not receiving a response from the client before the configured timeout.
* `Messages`: Total count of new messages recieved since node startup.
* `Rate`: The per-second rate of new messages over the previous two statsd intervals (available only when graphite integration is enabled).
* `Connections`: Current number of connected clients.

#### Client Connections:

* `Client Host`: Client ID (hostname) and on-hover the connection remote-address.
* `Protocol`: NSQ protocol version and client user-agent.
* `Attributes`: TLS and AUTH connection state.
* `NSQd Host`: Address of the nsqd node this client is connected to.
* `In-flight`: Current count of messages awaiting response that have been delivered to this client.
* `Ready Count`: Max number of messages that can be in-flight on this connection. This is controlled by a client's `max_in_flight` setting.
* `Finished`: Total count of messages that this client has finished (`FIN`).
* `Requeued`: Total count of messages that this client has requeued (`REQ`).
* `Messages`: Total count of messages delivered to this client.
